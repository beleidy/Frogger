### 2. How to play the game

The goal of the game is to get the boy to cross the stones and reach the water.
You win by reaching the water without colliding with any of the enemy bugs.
If you collide with a bug, you will be sent back to your first position on the grass.
If you win, you will see a Win message on the screen before being reset back to your initial position.

Every time you win, you go one level up, and an extra enemy bug is added. Every time you lose you go a level down and an enemy bug is removed.

- How to move the character

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the boy. The up arrow moves him up, right arrow to the right,
left arrow to the left, and the down arrow down.

Happy Crossing!
