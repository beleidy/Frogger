===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

1. How to install the game

- Unzip all files into a folder on your computer
- Use Google Chrome, to open index.html

Do not change the locations of the files relative to each other after you have unzipped them
otherwise the game will not work properly.

2. How to play the game

The goal of the game is to get the boy to cross the stones and reach the water.
You win by reaching the water without colliding with any of the enemy bugs.
If you collide with a bug, you will be sent back to your first position on the grass.
If you win, you will see a Win message on the screen before being reset back to your initial position.

- How to move the character

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the boy. The up arrow moves him up, right arrow to the right,
left arrow to the left, and the down arrow down.

Happy Crossing!
